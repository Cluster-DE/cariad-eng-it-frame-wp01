# Multi-client file share

## Introduction

    Project Overview: Describe the goal of the POC project (deploying infrastructure using Terraform, with one VNet in Europe containing a file share and another in the US with VMs that mount the file share).
    Technical Objective: Explain the primary objective, including specific infrastructure components (VNet, file share, VMs) and regions involved.

## Prerequisites

    Terraform: List the version of Terraform, along with any specific modules or plugins required.
    Azure/AWS/GCP Setup (depending on the cloud provider): Describe any required accounts, permissions, and resource groups.
    Networking Knowledge: Mention that understanding VNet peering or inter-region connectivity is required.
    Other Tools: List any additional tools (CLI tools, API clients, etc.) needed to implement the solution.

## Architecture Diagram

    Include a high-level diagram that outlines the overall infrastructure, including:
        VNet in Europe (with a file share)
        VNet in the US (with multiple VMs)
        Network Peering (or any other cross-region networking solution)
        Connectivity between the VMs and file share
        Security Groups/Firewalls

## IaC approach
    



## Resource Definitions

Provide details on the actual resources created using Terraform:

    Europe VNet: Include the CIDR block, subnets, and other key configurations.
    File Share Resource: Document the file share type (e.g., Azure File Share, AWS EFS, etc.), its size, performance tiers, and network accessibility.
    US VNet: Include VM sizes, OS images, and configuration details.
    Cross-region Networking: Explain how the VNets are connected (e.g., VNet Peering in Azure, VPN, etc.).
    Security Settings: Describe any security group rules or firewall configurations.

## Networking and Connectivity

    Peering/VPN: Provide detailed steps on setting up VNet peering (or a VPN) to ensure the VMs in the US can communicate with the file share in Europe.
    DNS Resolution: Describe how DNS will resolve the file shareâ€™s address from the VMs in the US.
    Latency Considerations: Address any cross-region latency issues that might affect the mounting of the file share.

##  Benchmarking & Testing

    Mounting File Share: Provide detailed steps on how to mount the file share on the VMs, including any necessary credentials or commands.
    File Share Access: Explain how to test that the VMs can successfully read/write to the file share.
    Connectivity Testing: Provide steps for testing cross-region connectivity (e.g., ping, traceroute, etc.).

##  Troubleshooting

    Common Issues: List potential issues like peering misconfigurations, file share mounting issues, or firewall blocking, and provide solutions.
    Logs & Debugging: Include information on where to find logs and how to debug Terraform deployment errors or connectivity problems.

## Conclusion

    Summary of Setup: Recap the infrastructure deployed and its success.
    Next Steps: Mention any future enhancements (e.g., setting up monitoring, scaling the solution, etc.).
