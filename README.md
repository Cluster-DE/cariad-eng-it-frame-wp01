# Multi-client file share

## Introduction

    The goal of this PoC is to showcase how to setup a high-performance cross-regional fileshare. 

## Prerequisites

   - Terraform
   - Azure CLI
   - Powershell

## Architecture Diagram

## IaC approach
    
    We are using Terraform for our IaC strategy. The goal is to create a modularized, secure deployment

## Resource Definitions

    VM-Clients
    - VMs running with windows server, datacenter editio 2022. 
    - VMs can be replicated however often is required
    - Extensions are used, to ensure the mounting process & dependency management is run for each deployment
    - Accesable with RDP

    Storageaccount:
    - Standard storage account
    - Has a file share, which we later mount to the VMs
    - Private link to ensure security

    Keyvault: 
    -  Contains any secrets that we need along the way

    VNET:
    - We have two VNETs, one for each region. 
    - VNETs are peered with each other
    - We manage the firewall using SecurityGroups on the VNET level.
    

## Networking and Connectivity

    Peering/VPN: Provide detailed steps on setting up VNet peering (or a VPN) to ensure the VMs in the US can communicate with the file share in Europe.
    DNS Resolution: Describe how DNS will resolve the file shareâ€™s address from the VMs in the US.
    Latency Considerations: Address any cross-region latency issues that might affect the mounting of the file share.

##  Benchmarking & Testing

    Mounting File Share: Provide detailed steps on how to mount the file share on the VMs, including any necessary credentials or commands.
    File Share Access: Explain how to test that the VMs can successfully read/write to the file share.
    Connectivity Testing: Provide steps for testing cross-region connectivity (e.g., ping, traceroute, etc.).

##  Troubleshooting

    Common Issues: List potential issues like peering misconfigurations, file share mounting issues, or firewall blocking, and provide solutions.
    Logs & Debugging: Include information on where to find logs and how to debug Terraform deployment errors or connectivity problems.

## Conclusion

    Summary of Setup: Recap the infrastructure deployed and its success.
    Next Steps: Mention any future enhancements (e.g., setting up monitoring, scaling the solution, etc.).
